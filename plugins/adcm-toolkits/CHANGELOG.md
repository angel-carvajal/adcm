# Changelog — adcm-toolkits

## 0.11.0 — 2026-09-19

- `business-context-generator`: mines EXISTING sources before interviewing — sales
  decks, database migrations and price catalogs, quoting tools, a sibling venture's
  execution docs, brand tokens and memory files — fanning out one sub-agent per
  source family under the same 20-agent tiered protocol; consolidates a fact sheet
  where every fact carries its source path, date, confidence and confidentiality
  class, then interviews only for the UNKNOWNs.
- `execution-prompt-architect` / `references/project-structure.md`: documents the two
  container homes (own ventures `~/<venture>/` vs. client work
  `~/clientes_projects/<client>/`), the three supported positions of `ai-brain`
  (canonical `ai/ai-brain/`, container-root `ai-brain/`, `docs/ai-brain/` + mandatory
  symlink) and why the `artifact-guard` Stop hook only discovers two of them,
  marketplace naming variants (`-admin`, `-common`, `-commercial`, `-platform`,
  `-academic`), the bilingual document-name sets (rule 9, `task.md`/`execute.md`
  never translate), and Day-0 `directory`-source marketplace registration for a
  brand-new client (rule 10).
- `execution-prompt-architect` SKILL.md: filenames now explicitly follow the
  venture's chosen document-name set, not just the interaction language; orchestrator
  direct fixes (the ≤~20-line escalation-ladder shortcut) must be LOGGED in the
  `task.md` logbook; Step 7 reworked into "the visual artifacts" — `plans.html`
  (stakeholders) plus `prompts.html` (the operator, on a phone; regenerated from
  `execute.md` §7's `### Wave <ID>` headers, never hand-edited) — both registered in
  `artifacts.json` and republished on change; the registry/guard discovery
  documented against the two positions it can actually see.
- Templates: `execute.md.tmpl`, `wave-prompt.tmpl` and `task.md.tmpl` gained the
  `orchestrator fix:` logbook field, the `prompts.html` regeneration step
  (`prompts-regen.py`) in the doc-sync close, and the doc-name-set note in every
  "keep the document name" instruction (6 templates). Ships `prompts-regen.py` +
  `prompts-html.tmpl` — the `prompts.html` generator script and its HTML shell.
- `code-project-context-generator`: container/brain detection now points at
  `project-structure.md`'s "Where ai-brain may live" and documents the
  `-common`/`-platform`/`-commercial` marketplace variants.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-09-15

- Reuse-first planning, comment policy, and a code-simplifier pass over every wave's
  integrated diff before the final DoD run.

## 0.9.1 — 2026-09-15

- `design-direction-architect`: the research phase before any UI is built.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-09-07

- `agentic-seo-report`: SEO + agent-readiness audits with confidentiality
  guardrails.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-06

- Orchestrator/auditor/executor tiers (Fable orchestrates, Opus audits and runs
  gates, Sonnet implements) with an escalation ladder.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-09-05

- Agent budget of 20 with tiered roles (executor implements, opus/sonnet
  sub-agents audit).

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-02

- Hard cap of 5 sub-agents per phase and per wave session (ultracode included).

## 0.6.6 — 2026-09-02

- Close block always delivers `localhost` alongside the LAN IP.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-09-02

- `artifact-guard` v3 enforces the close-links FORMAT (Markdown link per line, last
  lines of the message, nothing after).

## 0.6.4 — 2026-08-28

- Closes are read on a phone: tappable links + media last.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-08-28

- Hardened `artifact-guard` against review findings.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-08-28

- Published artifacts registry + deterministic close guard (plus pre-publish review
  fixes).

## 0.6.1 — 2026-08-27

- Two hard rules learned in real wave execution; everything AI lives under `ai/`
  (`ai/ai-brain` + `modules/<mod>` lazy doc).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-25

- Codified the project container convention (`projects/` grouping, one git repo per
  engineering project, ALL docs in `ai-brain`; review fixes and template sync).

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-17

- Self-contained wave prompts + usage-map (shared surfaces → consumer census).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-03

- Added the `business-context-generator` skill.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-07-04

- Project name + timeframe plan + Timeline Gantt.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-06-25

- Baked the code-legibility (anti indentation-hell) convention into generated
  plans; wave Status markers enforced at close (§7); mandatory VISUAL CHECK for UI
  waves.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-12

- Added the `execution-prompt-architect` skill.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-06 / 2026-06-07

- Initial public release; `code-project-context-generator` enhanced into a richer,
  refreshable knowledge base; marketplace translated to English with per-skill
  READMEs.
